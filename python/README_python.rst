motifcluster
============

A Python package for motif-based spectral clustering of weighted directed networks.

Introduction
------------
The **motifcluster** package provides
implementations of motif-based spectral clustering
of weighted directed networks in Python.
These provide the capability for:

- Building motif adjacency matrices
- Sampling random weighted directed networks
- Spectral embedding with motif adjacency matrices
- Motif-based spectral clustering

The methods are all designed to run quickly on large sparse networks,
and are easy to install and use.

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: bash

  pip install motifcluster

Dependencies
------------
- Networkx
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn
