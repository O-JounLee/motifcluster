## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use the
`motifclustr` package for motif-based spectral
clustering of weighted directed networks.

First we load the package.

```{r setup}
library(motifclustr)
```

## Sampling a weighted directed network

We will start by randomly sampling some weighted directed networks which
exhibit some latent structure.
For this we use directed stochastic block models (DSBMs).
